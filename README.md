Feel free to explore the code, and let me know if you have any questions or need further details.

## 2. A readme with the info of an software that i made

One of my recent projects is [apply-bot](https://github.com/knameless27/apply-bot). The goal of this bot is to automate and streamline the process of job applications by leveraging user data and sending applications to predefined job portals. The software simplifies the process by filling out repetitive forms and ensuring all required fields are completed, significantly reducing the time spent on each application.

## 3. Project Participation and Roles

  [Virgen de Guadalupe Clinic](https://clinicavirgenguadalupe.com/es/).
  
[Cupons Page - 360 Clinic Management](https://360clinicmanagement.com/landing/Cup%C3%B3n%20General)
(Note: We are currently migrating Vuexy to the latest version. The layout and responsive elements are being adjusted, but functionality was the priority during this phase.)

### Personal Projects:

[Portfolio](https://knameless.ca):
This project was a personal challenge, where I developed a portfolio using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to test my skills in building a site from scratch.

[CinemaFront](https://github.com/knameless27/cinemaFront):
I was responsible for the front-end development and implemented CRUD operations for the admin side. I also developed the booking system for customers to reserve their seats.

[CinemaBack](https://github.com/knameless27/cinemaBack):
On the back-end, I worked on various features, including authentication, reservations, and email notifications, providing an end-to-end solution for the cinema management system.

## 4. A Tough Technical Problem Solved

In my previous role, I worked on an internal logistics management system for a medical clinic, which involved synchronizing patient data between multiple APIs. One challenge was dealing with inconsistencies in the data formats and response times from third-party services. To resolve this, I developed an intermediary data-processing layer that could handle asynchronous API calls, normalize the data in real-time, and store it in a cache to improve response times for end-users.

This solution not only reduced the data inconsistency issues but also improved the performance of the platform, allowing medical staff to access updated information without delays.

## 5. A Challenging Interpersonal Situation

During my time working on a team project, there was a communication issue with a client regarding the scope of a feature. The client had an unclear vision, which led to some misunderstandings and delays. To resolve this, I scheduled a dedicated meeting where I actively listened to their concerns and asked specific questions to clarify their needs. I then created detailed mockups and wireframes to ensure both the technical team and the client were on the same page moving forward. This helped regain trust, improved the workflow, and avoided further misunderstandings.

## 6. Availability

Yes, I am available to work during Montreal business hours, 9am to 5pm EST, and can fully align my schedule with those working hours.
